# Graph Algorithms
These are the graph algorithms we have discussed in MA 4208 at Michigan Technological University, programmed in Python 3.9.

We use Graphs, Algorithms, and Optimization (Second Edition) by William L Kocay and Donald L Kreher.

For more information please refer to the documentation which can be found [here](https://classdb.it.mtu.edu/~mjschwen/docs/GraphAlgorithms/index).

## Libraries Used
I use [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/) to store the graph and GraphGen uses [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) to visualize the graph (not that it is very good at it...).

These can be installed using `pip` as seen below.
```
pip install networkx
pip install matplotlib
```
